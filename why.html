You can store photos on a hard drive, however these too are at times troublesome. We believe our service is more than scrapbooking and we would like to help you understand why we are passinate about this. We have listed a few senarios where this new technology superceeds anything else currently available.

                                    <p>Imagine your niece has sent you a birthday card. Everytime you see this card it fills you heart and mind with love and joy so you try your hardest to save it. For one reason or another (natural ware and tare, moving house, floods or fires) you lose this card. The memory and specific connection is now lost. We can turn sentimental items like this into an NFTs so you can pristinely save these memories for generations.</p>

                                    <p>We are offering 10 NFTs for around $100CAD. We offer tailor made packages if needed, please get in contact for details. <br>
                                    We have a top of the line scanner, custom written software and here's one of the ways it gets interesting....<br>
                                    Each NFT you recieve will have a mint price of $10 meaning that you will have a portfolio worth $100. Your cost will be $100 and you will recieve a collection of art worth $100. If you chose to sell the art we can program the NFT to give
                                    your little one 10% of every transaction after the initial sale. If interest generates around your little one in the future the value of your NFTs could skyrocket.</p>

                                    <p>We are a very small team of stay at home parents living in the Victoria, BC.  We set out to learn more about the Crypto world late last year 
                                        and this is where we have ended up, knee deep in code, articles, kid's art work and so many late nights learning. We are excited about this project and 
                                        are already seeing the multifacited value of this. We told our 4 year old that his artwork was now published online and he could not wait to show his 
                                        Papa in Scotland, the pride and excitment on his face was worth every penny!</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <input type="checkbox" checked>

                                    <h2 id="accordion-header">Some technical info on the process.</h2>
                                    <p>We will be minting the NFTs onto the Solana blockchain. This network is popular related to its affordable, speed and 
                                        scalability. There are many talented coders working with the Solana blockchain. Positioning our NFTs in this ecosystem will give our clients the best chance
                                        to get the most from their NFTs. We use some well supported libraries to mint onto the blockchain and some custom made software to write all the data needed 
                                        to interact with these libraries. We plan to get our process audited by third party specialists until then we are minting 
                                        the NFTs as mutable. This means that if there are any issues with the process we can fix the NFT quickly and easily. Once our process has been audited we will lock the existing NFTs and mint future NFTs and non-mutable.
