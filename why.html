                                        <p>Imagine sitting with your grandkids and they ask to hear more about their parents. You dig through the dusty cupboards and water-damaged boxes only to find tattered, faded books and pieces of squished paper. You enjoy touching history, but it is so damaged and worn that you know it will not be long until it fades away. Creating a collection with ScrapNook will allow you to reach for your phone or iPad and, at the click of a button, have access to hundreds of memories in pristine condition. Not only will you have access to this you can pass these onto your grandkids for them to pass on to their kids.</p>

                                        <p>There are many ways you can use your NFTs, we would like to show you one usecase by running an art show. Once ScrapNook has created 1000 NFTs we will celebrate by holding an online show.</p>
                                        <p>We will randomly select 25 artists and showcase their work on our specially designed site. Each selected artist will recieve payment for displaying their art and will be paid straight to their NFT wallet.</p>
                                        <p>The competition will involve the website visitors voting for their favourite art and we will give additional prize money to the top 5 NFTs.</p>
                                        <p>Our hope is that this event will facilitate a real life teaching moment for our little ones and also help people see the multitude of benefits NFT technology has in this application.</p>
                                        <!-- <p>Facebook allowed us to upload albums of photos to highlight special moments in our year. Then Instagram came along, and we started uploading single posts which encapsulated the experience. Now what happens if these companies close your account? All your photos and posts would be permanently deleted! We can convert your highlights into NFTs which would allow you to keep full ownership of these photos and posts. You and your family are important enough for Scrapnook to archive your greatest moments. Give us your photos and posts and we will give you back a legacy. </p>                                     -->
