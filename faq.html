                                    <p>NFT stands for Non Fungable Token.
                                    For our application, NFTs are modern day collectables. We are in essence publishing your little one's art as a digital scrapbook and stamping it with metadata for authenticity. Much like baseball cards, their value appreciated along with the players' career progression. NFTs have similar appreciation potential, so or goal is to turn your little one's art into an asset with the chance to appreciate.</p>

                                    <h2 id="accordion-header">What is the future of NFTs?</h2>
                                    <p>NFTs have been around since 2014 and became extremly popular in 2021, with that popularity some NFTs from notable people were selling for millions.<br>
                                    There is currently a downturn of this speculative value, however it is giving room for the techonolgy itself to shine. Brands and bands are      
                                    using NFTs, artists and entertainers are using them, each in their own unique ways.
                                    At Scrapnook we believe our application of this technology is where it shines the most.
                                    We don't know where it will lead, but we do know NFT technology will be in our future.</p>

                                    <p>Please check our Facbook page for a list of fundraising events we are involved in. We aim give local schools as many packages as possible to contribute to their fundraising efforts. Let's support the wonderful staff and kids at our local schools first.
                                        We are starting a pre-sale list so we can guage the interest in this idea and once we get enough interest we will go live. To get yourself on the pre-sale list click the button on our contacts page.</p>

                                    <p>We are offering 10 NFTs for around $100CAD. We offer tailor made packages if needed, please get in contact for details. <br>
                                    We have a top of the line scanner, custom written software and here's one of the ways it gets interesting....<br>
                                    Each NFT you recieve will have a mint price of $10 meaning that you will have a portfolio worth $100. Your cost will be $100 and you will recieve a collection of art worth $100. If you chose to sell the art we can program the NFT to give
                                    your little one 10% of every transaction after the initial sale. If interest generates around your little one in the future the value of your NFTs could skyrocket.</p>

                                    <p>We are a very small team of stay at home parents living in the Victoria, BC.  We set out to learn more about the Crypto world late last year 
                                        and this is where we have ended up, knee deep in code, articles, kid's art work and so many late nights learning. We are excited about this project and 
                                        are already seeing the multifacited value of this. We told our 4 year old that his artwork was now published online and he could not wait to show his 
                                        Papa in Scotland, the pride and excitment on his face was worth every penny!</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <input type="checkbox" checked>

                                    <h2 id="accordion-header">Some technical info on the process.</h2>
                                    <p>We will be minting the NFTs onto the Solana blockchain. This network is popular related to its affordable, speed and 
                                        scalability. There are many talented coders working with the Solana blockchain. Positioning our NFTs in this ecosystem will give our clients the best chance
                                        to get the most from their NFTs. We use some well supported libraries to mint onto the blockchain and some custom made software to write all the data needed 
                                        to interact with these libraries. We plan to get our process audited by third party specialists until then we are minting 
                                        the NFTs as mutable. This means that if there are any issues with the process we can fix the NFT quickly and easily. Once our process has been audited we will lock the existing NFTs and mint future NFTs and non-mutable.
