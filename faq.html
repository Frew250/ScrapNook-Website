                                        <p>The blockchain is an online ledger. A series of data blocks with a record of transactions within it, for example - Wallet A paid Wallet B $5. The currency that transacts is the coin associated with that blockchain. There are millions of transactions per day and each block is linked together and visible to all. These online ledgers are stored on multiple computers across the network making it impossible for any one organization to control or manipulate</p>                                    </li>

                                        <!-- <p>NFT stands for Non Fungable Token. For our application, NFTs are modern day collectables. We are in essence publishing your little one's art as a digital scrapbook and stamping it with metadata for authenticity. Much like baseball cards, their value appreciated along with the players' career progression. NFTs have similar appreciation potential, and we want to set your art work up to give it the potencial to appreciate.</p> -->
                                        <p>NFT stands for Non-Fungible-Token. Some very smart people in 2014, figured out that they could write some code and insert some data into the blockchain. They linked that piece of data to a video they owned (photo and video files can be used). This action is called minting.  By minting this video onto the blockchain it meant that anyone who had the address of this mint could look it up and play the video. They in essence published this video online with a signature of ownership very much like an artist displays work in a gallery with their signature at the bottom</p>                                    </li>

                                        <p>The benefits of NFTs are multifaceted and ever-developing since people are thinking of new ways to apply the technology all the time. We are utilizing the technologies ability to store these images pristinely, for generations. We are also making use of the ability to track ownership of each NFT allowing us to identify original creations by our clients. This is important in the same way that owning an original baseball card, or Pokémon card is important. Value is assigned to original items of popular things.</p>                                    </li>

                                        <p>Adding an NFT collection to your existing scrapbook collections will give you the peace of mind that you can pass down these memories to your grandchildren. Those of us who appreciate the joy of our kid’s art but are just not great at storing them, now have an option to save these moments. Minting NFTs in essence turns your files into assets with the chance to appreciate, having a certified original of anything is valuable however imagine Andy Warhol had a certified original of his work as a youngster.</p>                                    </li>

                                    <h2 id="accordion-header">What is the future of NFTs?</h2>
                                    <p>NFTs became extremly popular in 2021, with that popularity some NFTs from notable people were selling for millions.<br>
                                    There is currently a downturn of this speculative value, however it is giving room for the techonolgy itself to shine. Brands and bands are      
                                    using NFTs, artists and entertainers are using them, each in their own unique ways.
                                    At Scrapnook we believe our application of this technology is where it shines the most.
                                    We don't know where it will lead, but we do know NFT technology will be in our future.</p>

                                    <p>We are a very small team of stay at home parents living in the Victoria, BC.  We set out to learn more about the Crypto world late last year 
                                        and this is where we have ended up, knee deep in code, articles, kid's art work and so many late nights learning. We are excited about this project and 
                                        are already seeing the multifacited value of this. We told our 4 year old that his artwork was now published online and he could not wait to show his

                                    <p>We will be minting the NFTs onto the Solana blockchain. This network is popular related of its affordable, speed, and scalability. Many talented coders are working on the Solana blockchain and positioning our NFTs in this ecosystem will give our clients the best chance to get the most from their NFTs. We use well-supported libraries to mint onto the blockchain and custom-made software to write all the data needed to interact with these libraries. We use Arweave storage solutions along with our smart contract to complete the NFT package. We plan to get our process audited by third-party specialists to ensure our workflow is flawless and remains up to date. Until then we are minting the NFTs as mutable. This means that if there are any issues with the process, we can fix the NFT quickly and easily. Once our process has been audited, we will lock the existing NFTs and mint future NFTs and non-mutable ones.</p>
