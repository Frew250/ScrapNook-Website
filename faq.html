                                    <p>NFT stands for Non Fungable Token. <br>
                                    For our application, NFT's are modern day collectables. We are in essence publishing your little one's art as a digital scrapbook and stamping it with metat data to prove its authenticity. Much like baseball cards, when printed they were worth only what the shop sold them for, but as the players career progressed the value of their card increased. We mint NFT's by inserting pieces of data onto the blockchain and have that data refernce your art</p>

                                    <h2 id="accordion-header">What is the future of NFT's?</h2>
                                    <p>NFT's have been around since 2014 but became extremly popular in 2021, with that popularity some NFt's from notable people were selling for millions.<br>
                                    We are currently in a downturn of this speculative value, however it is giving room for the techonolgy itself to shine. Brand's and band's are      
                                    using NFT's, artists and entertainers are using them, each in their own unique ways.
                                    At Scrapnook we believe our application of this technology is where it shines the most.
                                    We dont know where it will lead, but we do know NFT technology wil be in our future, so we want to get a jumps start and we would love you guys to come along for the ride. </p>

                                    Each NFT's you recieve will have a mint price of $10 meaning that you will have a portfolio worth $200. In essence you will pay $200 and recieve a collection of art back worth $100. If you chose to sell the art we can program the NFT to give
                                    your little one 10% of every transaction after the first sale. If interest generates around your little one or their work the value of these NFTs can skyrocket.</p>

                                    <p>We are a very small team of stay at home parents living in the Victoria, BC.  We set out to learn more about the Crypto world late last year 
                                        and this is where we have ended up, knee deep in code, articles, kid's art work and so many late nights learning. We are excited about this project and 
                                        are already seeing the multifacited value of this. We told our 4 year old that his artwork was now published online and he could not wait to show his 
                                        Papa in Scotland, the pride and excitment on his face was worth every penny!</p>
