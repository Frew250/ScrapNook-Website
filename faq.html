                                    <p>First, a blockchain exists for each cryptocurrency. Each blockchain is a list of transactions grouped in blocks and linked together by addresses. Each transaction is a simple send and receive record like account A sent account B $5. All this data on this blockchain is duplicated and distributed across multiple systems which creates a network with more than one source of truth. This is important because it makes records impossible to change, hack or manipulate. Most blockchains are public and every transaction can be traced back to its origin wallet.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li >

                                    <h2 id="accordion-header">What is an NFT?</h2>
                                    <p>NFT stands for Non-Fungible-Token. Some very smart people in 2014, figured out that they could write some code and insert some data into the blockchain. They linked that piece of data to one of their homemade videos (photo and video files can be used). This action is called minting.  By minting this video onto the blockchain it meant that anyone who had their address could look it up and play the video. They in essence published this video online with a signature of ownership very much like an artist displays work in a gallery with their signature on the bottom.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li >

                                    <h2 id="accordion-header">What are the benifits?</h2>
                                    <p>The benefits of NFTs are multifaceted and the untapped potential is huge. At Scrapnook we are utilizing the technology’s ability to store these images pristinely, for generations, and its ability to track ownership of each NFT to its origins. This is important in the same way that owning an original baseball card or Pokémon card is. Value is assigned to certified originals of popular things.</p>

                                    <p>Adding an NFT collection to your existing scrapbook collections will give you the peace of mind that you can pass down these memories for generations. Those of us who appreciate the joy of our kid’s art but are just not great at storing it, now have an option to save these special items. Minting NFTs also turns your files into more than just files they become assets with the chance to appreciate. Imagine Andy Warhol had a certified original of his work as a youngster. </p>

If you are interested in buying a package, please ask us about the fundraising events we are involved with. We are currently focusing on offering our services to our local area - Victoria, BC.

                                    <p>Our main package is 10 NFTs for $100CAD. We will offer tailor-made packages if needed, so please get in contact for details. <br>
                                        We have a top-of-the-line scanner, custom-written software, and our very own visualizer web app. We plan to continually upgrade our visualizer app to give you the best experience possible, you will automatically be grandfathered into any updates or new features. We will be keeping up-to-date with developments in NFT technology so that you get the most from your NFTs.
                                        If you chose to, you could sell your NFTs. The level of interest will directly affect the price. After the initial sale, you will also be paid a royalty of 10% for every single sale thereafter.

                                    <p>We will be minting the NFTs onto the Solana blockchain. This network is popular related of its affordability, speed, and scalability. Many talented coders are working on the Solana blockchain and positioning our NFTs in this ecosystem will give our clients the best chance to get the most from their NFTs. We use well-supported libraries to mint onto the blockchain and custom-made software to write all the data needed to interact with these libraries. We use Arweave storage solutions along with our smart contract to complete the NFT package. We plan to get our process audited by third-party specialists to ensure our workflow is flawless and remains up to date. Until then we are minting the NFTs as mutable. This means that if there are any issues with the process, we can fix the NFT quickly and easily. Once our process has been audited, we will lock the existing NFTs and mint future NFTs and non-mutable.</p>
